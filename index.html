          <h1>Zurich</h1>
          <p>Zurich is full of surprises, from the Giacometti-designed police station to the ambitious Freitag Tower, a skyscraper made completely from recycled materials. This compact city is easily explored on foot, and if you’re looking for the quintessential Swiss experience, Altstadt (Old Town) doesn’t disappoint. Explore its medieval pathways and visit landmarks such as the FIFA World Football Museum and the upscale Bahnhofstrasse shopping street.</p>

There’s even an annual cheese festival, just in case all of that wasn’t Swiss enough for you.

      <h1> Swiss National Museum </h1>
      <p class="P-Cont">
        The Swiss National Museum examines Zurich culture through a wealth of artefacts, from distant prehistory to the modern day. Founded in 1898, the museum occupies a turreted, neo-Gothic building between Platzspitz Park and Zurich Main Station. A tour through this museum’s extensive collection will take you to the medieval treasury's gem-encrusted relics, the armoury tower's jousting paraphernalia, and various archaeological discoveries – one of the museum’s most valuable relics is a 100,000-year-old flint stone.

        <p class="P-Cont">
        The city’s largest urban park, Rieterpark covers 70,000 sq m of green space near Lake Zürich. It’s a popular spot for recreational activities, including picnics, jogging, and sports. The area surrounding the park’s fountain is often used for classical concerts during summertime. Perched on a green hill above Lake Zürich, Museum Rietberg occupies an impressive neoclassical mansion, where Wagner once set Mathilde Wesendonck's poems to music. Today, the museum displays non-European works, including Tibetan bronzes, Indian miniatures, and Aztec sculptures.
